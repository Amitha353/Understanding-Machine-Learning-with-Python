Machine Learning
------------------
Building a model from example inputs to make data-driven predictions versus following strictly static program instructions.
Application:

1. Email a spam?
2. How can cars drive themselves?
3. What will people buy?

Machine Learning
-----------------
2 categories
a. Supervised;
  - Value Prediction
  - Needs training data containing value being predicted, the trained model predicts value in the new model;
b. Unsupervised;
   - Identify clusters of like data;
   - Data does not contain cluster membership, but model provides access to data by cluster;

Machine Learning WorkFlow:
--------------------------   
An orchestrated and repeatable pattern which systematically transforms and processes information to create prediction solutions.

1. Asking the right question;
2. Preparing data;
3. Selecting the algorithm;
4. Training the model;
5. Testing the model;

1. Asking the Right Question
-----------------------------
a. Define scope (including data sources);
 - Using Pima Indian Diabetes data, predict which people will develop diabetes.
 
b. Define target performance;
 - Using Pima Indian Diabetes data, predict with 70% or grater accuracy, which people will develop diabetes.
 
c. Define context for usage;
 - Using Pima Indian Diabetes data, predict with 70% or greater accuracy which people are likely to develop diabetes.
 
d. Define how solution is created;
 - Use the Machine Learning Workflow to process and transform Pima Indian data to create a predictin model. This model 
 must predict whih people are likely to develop diabetes with 70% or greater accuracy.
 
 2. Preparing data
 ---------------------
 a. Tidy Data
 - Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize,and have a specific structure:
 * each variable is a column;
 * each observation is a row;
 * each type of observational unit is a table;
 ** 50 - 80% of a ML project is spent getting, cleaning, and organizing data;
 
Data Rule #1:
---------------
- Closer the data is to what you are predicting, the better;

Data Rule #2:
--------------
- Data will never be in the format you need;
* Columns to eliminate - Not used, no values, duplicates;
* Correlated columns - Same information in different format, add little value, and cause algorithm to get confused;
* Modling Data - Adjusting data types, creating columns, if required;

Data Rule #3:
----------------
Accurately predicting rare events is difficule;

Data Rule #4:
--------------
Track how to manipulate data;
